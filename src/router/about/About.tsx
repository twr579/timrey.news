                                    I'm an Electrical & Computer Engineering graduate from The University of Texas at Austin,
                                    passionate about technology development and problem-solving. With hands-on experience in
                                    software engineering, web development, and embedded systems, I have successfully developed
                                    and optimized complex applications and hardware projects. My expertise spans multiple programming
                                    languages, frameworks, and tools, from JavaScript and React to Docker and microcontrollers. As a
                                    Web Development Intern at Plus One Robotics, I improved API performance, boosted testing coverage,
                                    and streamlined CI/CD pipelines. Iâ€™ve also designed embedded systems like an air quality monitor
                                    and digital thermometer, showcasing my skills in PCB design and real-time sensor data streaming.
